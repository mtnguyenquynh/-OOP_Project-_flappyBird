### Topic
Flappy Bird  
Why we choose this topic:  
The reason we chose Flappy Bird is because it is a simple game that fully demonstrates the essence of object-oriented programming. At the same time, we are also very curious about how the game set the Guinness World Record 2016 in terms of downloads and the huge revenue earned from it. We hope from this simple yet addictive game we can develop more features for it and keep this fun game.
